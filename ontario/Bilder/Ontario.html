        <p><strong>Provincial Flower:

        </strong>Ontario adopted the White Trillium as its official flower in 1937,
         originally considered for WWI graves abroad.</p>

                     In 1987, Canada replaced its one dollar bill with a coin, which featured a swimming loon on the tail side. It was quickly nicknamed the ‚Äúloonie‚Äù.</p> <img src="common-loon_2023-08-02-083402_angi.webp" alt="loon" id="loon"></div>
